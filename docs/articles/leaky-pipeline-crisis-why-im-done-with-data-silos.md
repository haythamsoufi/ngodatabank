# The "Leaky Pipeline" Crisis: Why I'm Done With Data Silos

Our current data infrastructure is built on "leak-prone" foundations: Kobo forms, SurveyMonkey links, Office forms, and one-off Excel files that don't talk to each other. By the time data reaches a global portal, it's been filtered, mangled, and diluted until it's barely recognizable.

In any other sector, that's a catastrophe; in the humanitarian sector, we call it "standard reporting."

Don't get me wrong: each of these tools was created for valid reasons. They are accessible, they solve an immediate need, and they allow teams to move fast when a crisis hits. But when we rely on them as our long-term backbone, we create a tragedy of fragmentation. We've been trapped in an exhausting loop for a decade: we collect data, dump it into a "lake," and hope that someone will magic it into a report, only to realize the data was broken before it even left the source.

But here is the hard truth: even if you manage to consolidate that mess and get a team to clean it, you will be back to zero the moment you collect new data with the same tools that caused the chaos in the first place. You cannot keep repeating this cycle.

For years, I've watched the humanitarian sector burn millions and different organisations invest individually to develop bespoke systems to meet specific data needs. This creates a layer of duplicate resources and high maintenance costs that offer no long-term sustainability and solves one tiny problem while creating ten new ones.

You're not just lost; you're burning resources that should be saving lives.

The irony is that even with all money spent, you'd still be solving the problem the wrong way. This isn't something you can patch or iterate out of. Incremental solutions just reproduce the same failure in a new format. The only way forward is a deliberately designed, end-to-end system that fixes the problem at its source. That's what I built.

## The Theory Nobody Would Fund

I've had this solution in my head for a long time. I'm sure others have too. But in the traditional development era, it wasn't enough for an idea to make sense; it had to come from the "right" level of seniority. And even when it wasn't, the barrier was financial: delivering what I envisioned, a full-stack backoffice, a public-facing portal, and mobile apps, you're looking at CHF 800,000, and that's the optimistic version.

In my current team at the IFRC, we had a plan to build a system like this, but the traditional funding didn't come (certain decisions made far away had very real consequences). In the old world of rigid procurement and million-dollar agency fees, that would have been the end of the story. The project would have stayed a PowerPoint deck, but then came "Vibe Coding."

I took a theory everyone assumed was too expensive to build and turned it into a production-ready system on my own terms. But this didn't start as a plan. It started as a bet.

I chose early to lean into AI and vibe coding, at a time when it still felt experimental. I began building this system almost casually, without a roadmap, without funding, and without seriously asking whether it could become real. It was something I pursued out of curiosity as much as conviction. I replaced Netflix with long sessions of Claude, music, and a few snacks, just building to see how far it could go.

When I shared the idea back then, it was often met with skepticism. It sounded too ambitious, too unconventional, and not serious enough to compete with traditional approaches. So I didn't push it. I just kept building.

What changed wasn't the idea, it was the speed of execution. AI removed the friction between concept and implementation. What would have taken years and a large team became something I could iterate on alone, fast enough to prove that the architecture actually works.

I didn't need a massive budget or a three-year roadmap. I needed a different way of building. I bypassed the red tape to create a system that forces the architecture to earn trust, so the data can finally make sense.

## What is the NGO Databank?

The NGO Databank is a unified, three-dimensional data ecosystem designed to remove the friction between collecting data and using it. It consolidates three years of humanitarian data lessons into one architecture so we move away from "collect first, clean later" toward data that is **clean by design**—not because someone heroically fixed it in Excel after the fact, but because definitions, ownership, and review are built into the same spine as the form.

The ecosystem has three primary pillars:

### 1. The Backoffice (The Engine)

This is the central workspace where administrators and data managers design standardized forms and tasks within a single configuration surface.

- **Unified definitions:** Countries, sectors, branches, and the Indicator Bank live here so the same definitions propagate across the whole stack. Once a template is ready, it is assigned to focal points—and, where appropriate, to public or mobile-facing assignments—who carry out data entry against those definitions.

- **Governed lifecycle:** Submissions move through a strict workflow—save, submit, validate, approve. Reviewers can challenge inconsistencies and enforce ownership inside the system, without exporting truth to side spreadsheets.

- **Administrative oversight:** Managers track assignments, monitor progress, run analytics, manage translations and resources, and import legacy data—all against the same canonical records field teams edit.

### 2. The Public Portal (The Face)

A transparent, outward-facing website—the public face of **Approved** data. It automatically pulls from those submissions to generate live maps, profiles, and dashboards for the public and partners, so what the world sees is tied to what has already passed review.

### 3. The Mobile App (The Pulse)

A personal data companion for every stakeholder, not only field teams:

- Submit data and track assignments.
- Access insights when the deployment allows.
- Operate in remote environments with offline-first capture and sync when connectivity returns.

## How AI is integrated (bounded governance)

The Backoffice hosts a practical AI layer built for utility, not spectacle. The accountability model is explicit: **humans approve what is official**; AI removes legwork and surfaces risk early.

### Workflow guidance

Conversational help supports staff navigating complex templates, policies, and procedures, using retrieval over **uploaded documents** and **workflow documentation** so the model understands what each step means in your programme's language.

### Knowledge base—not a disconnected chat

Behind the assistant sits a **governed knowledge layer** administrators curate: SOPs, methodologies, donor guidance, and other indexed material; plus—where policy and role permissions allow—**grounding from submitted data** so reasoning can reference the same history teams already trust, always scoped to what that user may see.

### Contextual reasoning

Where enabled, an **agent** reasons over **approved** indicator and submission context through **bounded, auditable tools**, so answers attach to actual database records rather than free-floating hallucination.

### Copilot in the form

The same stack runs **inside data entry**, not only in a sidebar. As a focal point types a value, optional **AI form-data validation** can offer an **opinion** when a figure looks **inconsistent**—for example against earlier submissions for the same indicator, against documents uploaded by the same reporting entity, or against other material in the knowledge base. The output is structured (for example *plausible*, *discrepancy*, *uncertain*) with **human-readable evidence**. It **flags**; it does not silently rewrite official numbers. Validators and approvers remain in charge.

### Expert assistant (Indicator Bank–grounded)

Staff can ask an assistant wired to the **Indicator Bank** and the curated corpus—definitions, units, reporting nuance, and "what does this process require?"—so questions about **tiny details** get answers anchored to what the system was configured to mean, not to a generic model guess.

### Cross-surface consistency

The same AI APIs can power companion experiences on the website or mobile app where you enable them, with permission boundaries and auditability consistent with the backoffice.

**The result:** before a number drives a global headline, it has travelled through definitions you agreed upfront, optional in-form checks, and human validation and approval. Integrity comes from **architecture and people together**—not from hoping nobody asks awkward questions after the fact.

## Governance by Design: Fixing the Architect, Not Just the Data

Most organizations try to fix data after it's collected. That's like trying to unscramble an egg. I'm done with "data governance policies" that live on paper and die in practice. My conviction is that governance must live in the workflow itself. In the NGO Databank ecosystem, we tackle "garbage in, garbage out" at the source:

**The Indicator Bank:** This is the heart of the system. Indicators are defined once, with clear metadata, units, and definitions. Forms reuse that vocabulary instead of inventing a new dialect for every exercise. If you want to track "People Reached," you use the standard, not a variation that breaks your aggregate. NGOs and particularly National Societies can manage their own indicator bank in this system, or reuse IFRC's indicator bank (even contribute to it) which is even better as it leads to a shared standard across the humanitarian sector.

**Pre-Deployment Guardrails:** Admins get real flexibility—repeating blocks, conditional logic, and calculated behavior. But the system is your co-pilot: if an indicator field isn't correctly linked to the Bank, deployment is blocked. You don't discover a mapping error in an Excel nightmare three months later; you fix it before you ship.

**The Governance Dashboard:** A single pane of glass to track system health. It surfaces gaps in data ownership and metadata completeness before they become a silent error in a global aggregate.

**Enforced Ownership:** Active collections require a named data owner. Accountability isn't a buzzword—it's a technical requirement for hitting "submit."

**Data Lifecycles:** Data moves through a real-world workflow (Save > Submit > Validate > Approve). "Final" actually means something because the path to get there is governed.

## Pragmatic bridges: Excel in the builder, KoBo without the silo

Governance at the source does not mean pretending the sector's habits do not exist. Teams still think in spreadsheets and still ship data through KoBoToolbox. The Backoffice meets them there—then lifts that work into one governed model.

**Excel inside the form builder.** In the template editor, **Excel Import/Export** is a first-class action on the toolbar—not a side script for engineers. You can export the full template structure (pages, sections, and items) to a structured workbook, work offline or in bulk with colleagues who live in Excel, and import the sheet back with validation so IDs and relationships stay consistent with the database. It is the same form you configure in the UI, just in a format large programmes already trust for review, translation rounds, and "what if we reorder these sections?" conversations.

**KoBo, without starting from zero.** If your indicators and questions already live in a KoBo project, you do not have to re-key them. Upload a standard **KoBo XLSForm** (Excel) and the system can **create a new template** from that definition in one path. For **submission data**, the **Import KoBo Data** wizard takes the Excel export you already download from KoBoToolbox, infers structure and types, walks you through **Upload → Review → Configure → Preview → Import** in a handful of guided steps, and either **spins up a new template from the export** or **maps columns onto an existing Databank template**—including sensible handling for sex/age style breakdown columns. You are not duct-taping two databases forever; you are using a few clicks to land historical KoBo work inside the same lifecycle and Indicator Bank discipline as everything else.

## From Vision to Global Scale: Deploying at IFRC

Because I was able to build this prototype rapidly via vibe coding, I was able to show my team that we didn't need to wait for traditional funding to solve our biggest data headaches.

The system has now been vetted across roles—from field-facing colleagues to global analysts. After surviving that gauntlet, NGO Databank is now heading into its first real-life, large-scale data collection. My team at the IFRC is deploying the Backoffice part of this ecosystem to support global reporting across 130 National Societies for the **2026 Unified Mid-year Reporting**. We are turning bottom-up accountability into something operational. In this model, National Societies own and manage their data at the source.

## The Power of Local Sovereignty: Internal Deployment for NGOs & NSs

While the global IFRC deployment proves the system's scale, the true magic happens when an individual NGO or National Society (NS) adopts the ecosystem as their own internal backbone. When you deploy this system, the power goes deeper—connecting branches, clinics, and volunteers into one seamless flow.

### Zero-Friction Orchestration: Configure Once, Use Everywhere

Most systems require you to configure a database, then a mobile app, then a dashboard separately. This architecture eliminates that "setup tax" through a singular point of control:

- **The Backoffice is the brain:** You only need to configure the system in the Backoffice. You define your sectors, branches, and Indicator Bank in one place.
- **Automatic propagation:** Once that single configuration is done, the Website and Mobile App already know exactly how to behave. They communicate with the Backoffice and auto-configure themselves by design.
- **Instant readiness:** Your field teams simply log in and start working. There is no manual mapping or "linking" required. It is plug-and-play at a global scale.

### Built for Humans, Optimized for AI Agents

I chose a modern tech stack (Python/Flask, Next.js, Flutter) specifically to lower the barrier for self-hosting and customization. But I took it a step further:

The source code is documented not just for human developers, but specifically for AI agents.

If an NGO wants to add a bespoke feature or customize a workflow, they don't need a massive dev shop. Because the codebase is structured for "vibe coding," an AI agent (like Claude or GPT) can ingest the documentation and immediately understand the system architecture.

- **Rapid customization:** Want to add a new reporting module? The AI agent already has what it needs to write the code that fits your specific context.
- **Low-cost evolution:** You can maintain and grow your own instance of the Databank with a fraction of the traditional technical overhead. You aren't just buying a tool; you're inheriting an agile ecosystem that evolves as fast as you can "vibe" it.

### Vertical Integrity, Horizontal Standards

The "Leaky Pipeline" is fixed because the data never leaves a governed environment.

- **Data stays "clean by birth":** Local branches use the same Indicator Bank definitions as the national HQ.
- **Seamless global sync:** When it comes time to report to global partners, there is no "export-clean-reformat" nightmare. Because the configuration is consistent across the entire system, the data flows from a clinic to a national dashboard, and eventually to the global portal, without losing a single drop of context or integrity.
- **Ownership at the source:** This is true digital localization. NGOs and National Societies own the server, manage the users, and control the permissions. They are no longer just "data providers" for international donors; they are the architects of their own digital transformation.

## From the Frontlines to the Dashboard: A System Born of Struggle

I didn't build this in a vacuum or a comfortable lab. This system is the direct result of my five years at the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). I lived these data struggles every single day in an environment where "standard procedure" often meets the harsh reality of war and infrastructure collapse.

This isn't just a "vetted" tool; it's a system designed to survive the entire food chain—from the volunteer in a basement during a blackout to the global analyst in Geneva. It addresses the real issues that occur at the lowest level of data entry, ensuring they don't become catastrophes at the highest level of decision-making. I built it for the places where Wi-Fi is a luxury, but the need for accurate information is a necessity for survival.

## Core Capabilities: Built for the Humanitarian Reality

Beyond the governance and the architecture, the NGO Databank is packed with features designed for the specific constraints of our sector:

- **Offline First:** A native mobile app designed for the most remote areas. Data is captured locally and syncs seamlessly only when connectivity returns, ensuring no story is lost to a bad signal.
- **True RTL Support:** Native, full Arabic support (and other Right-to-Left languages) that doesn't break your layouts. We speak the languages the teams actually work in.
- **Role-Based Access (RBAC):** A robust "master-key" system. In humanitarian work, data privacy isn't just a policy—it's protection. Sensitive data stays scoped strictly to those who need it.
- **Disciplined AI & knowledge base:** We use AI for precision, not "black box" magic. The Backoffice maintains a **governed knowledge base** (documents, workflows, the Indicator Bank, and—where permitted—submission history) and layers an **expert assistant** plus optional **in-form copilot** validation on top (see **How AI is integrated (bounded governance)** earlier in this article). Humans always retain approval authority.
- **Transparency by Design:** The public portal isn't an afterthought. It features automated maps, profiles, and disaggregation views that translate complex backoffice rigor into clear, public-facing accountability.

### AI, energy, and the cost of hoping nobody asks

Some people will ask a fair question: doesn't leaning on AI mean more datacentre load and a heavier environmental footprint? It can—if you use AI as entertainment, or to generate noise at planetary scale. That is not what this system is for.

The honest comparison is not "AI versus nothing." In real programmes, the alternative is weeks of **reactive** work: long email chains (often drafted and re-drafted with assistive tools anyway), attachments in five versions, meetings slipped because someone is waiting for a clarification, and analysts burning evenings fixing numbers that should never have been wrong. Every round trip has a carbon cost too—devices left on, storage, sync, travel when trust breaks down—and a human cost in delay and burnout.

When AI is **anchored in governed data**—definitions you already approved, submissions moving through validate and approve, answers tied to what the system actually holds—you spend fewer cycles "polishing prose" and more cycles **catching mistakes before they become official**. You can ask precise questions early ("does this indicator match the Bank?", "what is missing for approval?") and correct the record **once**, inside the workflow, instead of discovering a problem in a partner email a month later and opening a whole new chain of corrections. The point is not to hope no one questions the figures; it is to **invite** structured questions at the right moment, so the data is defensible the first time it leaves the building.

Used this way, AI is not a substitute for rigour—it is a pressure valve on the messier, more wasteful path: wrong data, silent doubt, and endless reactive email. Less theatre, fewer loops, faster trust. That is better for people, for decisions, and for the resources—electricity and attention—we were already going to spend one way or another.

## Let's Build the Future Together: Code as a Catalyst

The tech stack—Python (Flask), Next.js, and Flutter—was a calculated choice. In the humanitarian sector, we often get bogged down in "enterprise" frameworks that are powerful on paper but soul-crushing to maintain.

I chose Python because it is the native tongue of the AI revolution and the playground for the world's most creative developers. While other languages might boast marginal performance gains, they often feel rigid and uninspiring. Python is expressive; it invites experimentation and rapid iteration. It turns "building" back into an act of creation rather than a chore of compliance.

### Beyond the Paycheck: A Mission of Passion

I am looking for tech and data enthusiasts who prioritize technical excellence over bureaucratic box-ticking. My goal isn't to build a team driven by the obligation of a grant, but a community fueled by the thrill of solving impossible problems.

We are moving away from the "mercenary" model of humanitarian tech—where systems are built only when a budget line exists—toward a "missionary" model. This is for the creators who want to see their code actually save a life, not just sit in a repository.

### The vision for scale

The architecture is deliberately open and extensible. It is designed for partners to acquire true digital sovereignty—to adapt, scale, and innovate without shattering the core foundation.

It's time to stop pouring resources into isolated silos. Let's build a unified, governed data future—not because we're funded to, but because we finally have the tools to do it right.
