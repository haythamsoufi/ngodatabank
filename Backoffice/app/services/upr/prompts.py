"""
UPR prompt fragments.

Centralises all Unified Planning and Reporting (UPR) specific prompt text
so that the main prompt-policy, query-rewriter, and agent executor modules
can pull from a single source of truth.

The companion ``KNOWLEDGE.md`` (same directory) is the comprehensive domain
reference.  Use :func:`get_upr_knowledge` to load it at runtime — it is
suitable for injection into an LLM context window when deeper UPR domain
understanding is needed beyond the concise rules returned by
:func:`get_upr_prompt_section`.
