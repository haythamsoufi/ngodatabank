## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development - macOS only)
- CocoaPods (for iOS dependencies)
- Backoffice URL: http://localhost:5000

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd MobileApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase mobile config** (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`)

   In [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Project settings → Your apps, download the Android and iOS config files and place them at:

   - `android/app/google-services.json`
   - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

   Those paths are **gitignored** so API keys are not committed. The repo tracks only `android/app/google-services.json.example` and `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist.example` as templates. CI copies the examples before builds.

   **If keys were ever in a public repository:** rotate and revoke them in [Google Cloud credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) / Firebase, then use the new files locally.

4. **Configure environment variables** (optional for local development)
   
   The app supports two methods for providing API keys and configuration:
   
   **Option A: Using `.env` file (for local development)**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `MobileApp` directory (see `.env.example` if available)
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     MOBILE_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here  # Optional
     ```
   - The `.env` file is gitignored and will not be committed
   - Note: `.env` is no longer included in Flutter assets to avoid build errors in CI
   
   **Option B: Using `--dart-define` flags (for CI builds and production)**
   - Pass environment variables via command-line flags:
     ```bash
     flutter run --dart-define=MOBILE_APP_API_KEY=your_key
     ```
   - For CI builds, these are passed automatically from GitHub secrets
   
   **Priority order:**
   1. `.env` file (if available and loaded successfully)
   2. `--dart-define` flags
   3. Empty string (default)

5. **Add IFRC logo asset**
   - Place `ifrc_logo.png` in `assets/images/` directory
   - Or update the asset path in `lib/screens/login_screen.dart`

6. **iOS Setup** (macOS only)
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```
   See `docs/ios/setup.md` for detailed iOS setup instructions.

7. **Run the app**

   **For development (localhost):**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   **For staging (IFRC staging backoffice — `databank-stage.ifrc.org`):**
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=STAGING=true
   ```

   **For production (IFRC backoffice `databank.ifrc.org` + public site on Fly.io) in emulator:**
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true
   ```

   **For production on a specific device:**
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true -d <device-id>
   ```

   **For staging on a specific device:**
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=STAGING=true -d <device-id>
   ```
   
   To list available devices:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```

See the [Documentation](#documentation) section below for architecture and setup guides.

## Authentication

The app supports two authentication methods:

1. **Email/password**: Native authentication against Backoffice
2. **Azure AD B2C**: Single sign-on with your organization’s identity provider (when configured)

Quick test logins are available for development:
- Admin: `test_admin@ngo.org` / `test123`
- Focal Point: `test_focal@ngo.org` / `test123`

## WebView Integration

Complex backend pages are accessed via authenticated WebView:
- Template Management
- Assignment Management
- Form Builder
- Form Data Entry
- Admin Pages

Session cookies are automatically injected to maintain authentication.

## Offline Support

The app implements comprehensive offline support:

### Request Queuing
- Failed requests are automatically queued when offline
- Queued requests sync when connection is restored
- Maximum 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Visual indicator shows queued request count

### Response Caching
- GET requests are cached for offline access
- Default TTL: 1 hour (configurable)
- Cache stored in SQLite database
- Automatic cache invalidation

### Network Monitoring
- Real-time network status detection
- Automatic sync when connection restored
- Manual sync option available
- "Last synced" timestamp tracking

### Cached Data
- Dashboard data (1 hour expiration)
- User profile
- Entity list
- API responses (configurable TTL)

Cache is automatically refreshed on pull-to-refresh or app resume.

## Organization Configuration

The app supports organization-specific branding and configuration through JSON files. See `assets/config/README.md` for details.

Example:

```bash
# Build with a named organization profile (example: ifrc)
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=ORGANIZATION_CONFIG=ifrc --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true

# Build with default NGO Databank configuration
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true
```

## Building for Production

### Environment Configuration

The app supports three environments:
- **Staging**: Uses your configured staging Backoffice URL (see `assets/config/`). (For the IFRC staging profile this is `https://databank-stage.ifrc.org`.)
- **Production**: Backoffice/API traffic goes to **IFRC** (`https://databank.ifrc.org`). The public website used in-app is **`https://website-databank.fly.dev`** (Fly.io). Do not confuse IFRC production with `https://backoffice-databank.fly.dev` (a separate Fly-hosted preview).

### Android - Production APK

To build a production APK that uses the production host defaults above:

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true
```
To build a staging APK that connects to your staging Backoffice:
To build a staging APK that connects to databank-stage.ifrc.org:

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=STAGING=true
```

The APK will be generated at: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

**For development/testing with localhost:**
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or for debug builds
flutter build apk --debug
```

**For App Bundle (Google Play Store):**
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true
```

**For Staging App Bundle:**
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=STAGING=true
```

### iOS - Production Build

```bash
flutter build ios --release --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true
```

**For Staging Build:**
```bash
flutter build ios --release --dart-define=STAGING=true
```

**Note**: iOS builds require:
- macOS with Xcode installed
- Valid Apple Developer account for device testing
- CocoaPods dependencies installed (`cd ios && pod install`)
- See `ios/SETUP_IOS.md` for complete iOS setup guide

### Verifying Environment Configuration

After building with `--dart-define=PRODUCTION=true`, the app will:
- Call the Backoffice/API at **`https://databank.ifrc.org`** (unless overridden with `BACKEND_URL`)
- Load public website pages from **`https://website-databank.fly.dev`**
- Use HTTPS for all network requests

After building with `--dart-define=STAGING=true`, the app will:
- Connect to your configured staging Backoffice base URL (or `https://databank-stage.ifrc.org` when using the IFRC staging profile)
- Load website pages from `https://website-databank.fly.dev`
- Use HTTPS for all network requests

## Security Features

### WebView Security
- **URL Whitelist**: Only approved URLs can be loaded
- **Content Security Policy**: Injected to prevent XSS attacks
- **URL Validation**: All navigation validated before loading
- **Session Security**: Secure cookie storage and automatic refresh

### Authentication Security
- Session-based authentication with secure cookie storage
- Client-side session expiration validation
- Automatic session refresh before expiration
- Secure session rotation on cookie updates

### Data Security
- Sensitive data masking in logs
- Encrypted storage for credentials
- HTTPS-only in production environment
- Error tracking integration (Sentry - optional)

## API Service Features

### Request Interceptors
- Modify headers before requests
- Add custom headers dynamically
- Logging and monitoring

### Response Interceptors
- Process responses after requests
- Response logging
- Custom response handling

### Automatic Retry
- Retries transient failures (502, 503, 504, timeouts)
- Exponential backoff strategy
- Configurable retry count and delays
- Smart retry logic (no retry for 401, 400 errors)

## Troubleshooting

### Session Issues
If you experience authentication issues:
1. Logout and login again
2. Clear app data/cache
3. Check backend connectivity
4. Verify session expiration (should auto-refresh)

### WebView Not Loading
- Ensure backend URL is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Verify session cookie is valid
- Check URL whitelist (should match backend URL)

### Offline Issues
- Check network connectivity indicator
- Verify queued requests count
- Try manual sync
- Check cache expiration

### Build Issues
- Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
- Verify Flutter SDK version (>=3.0.0 <4.0.0)
- Check dependency versions in `pubspec.yaml`
- For iOS: Run `pod install` in `ios/` directory
